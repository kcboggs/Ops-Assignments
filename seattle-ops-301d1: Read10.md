# What is a DMZ Network?

DMZ Network also known as "Demilitarized Zone” behaves as a  
subnetwork containing an organization's exposed, outward-facing services. It acts  
as the exposed point to an untrusted networks, commonly the Internet.

 A DMZ will add an extra layer of security to an organization's LAN.   
A protected and monitored network node that faces outside the internal network can access  
what is exposed in the DMZ, while the rest of the organization's network is safe behind a firewall.

As long as its implemented properly, a DMZ Network gives organizations extra protection in detecting   
and mitigating security breaches before they reach the internal network, where valuable assets   
are stored.

# Purpose of a DMZ

The DMZ Network exists to protect the hosts most vulnerable to attack.  

The most common services are:

* Web servers
* Mail servers   
* FTP servers   

# DMZ Designs

* Single firewall   
* Dual firewall  

# Why DMZ Networks are Important

Home Internet enabled devices are built around a LAN which accesses the internet  
from a broadband router.

**DMZ’s are an essential part of network security for both individual users and large organizations.  
They provides an extra layer of security to the computer network by restricting remote access to   
internal servers and information, which can be very damaging if breached.**

# What is a web server?

**_The term web server can refer to hardware or software, or both of them working together._**

1. On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's  
component files. (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files) A web   
server connects to the Internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web.  

2. On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files.   
At a minimum, this is an HTTP server. An HTTP server is software that understands URLs (web addresses) and HTTP  
(the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the  
websites it stores, and it delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.
