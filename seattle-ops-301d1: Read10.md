# What is a DMZ Network?

DMZ Network also known as "Demilitarized Zone” behaves as a  
subnetwork containing an organization's exposed, outward-facing services. It acts  
as the exposed point to an untrusted networks, commonly the Internet.

The purpose of the DMZ is to add an extra layer of security to an organization's LAN.   
A protected and monitored network node that faces outside the internal network can access  
what is exposed in the DMZ, while the rest of the organization's network is safe behind a firewall.

When implemented properly, a DMZ Network gives organizations extra protection in detecting   
and mitigating security breaches before they reach the internal network, where valuable assets   
are stored.

# Purpose of a DMZ

The DMZ Network exists to protect the hosts most vulnerable to attack.  

The most common services are:

* Web servers:   
* Mail servers:   
* FTP servers:   

# DMZ Designs

* Single firewall:   
* Dual firewall:   

# Why DMZ Networks are Important

On many home networks, internet enabled devices are built around a local  
area network which accesses the internet from a broadband router. However,   
the router serves as both a connection point and a firewall, automating traffic  
filtering to ensure only safe messages enter the local area network. So, on a home  
network, a DMZ can built by adding a dedicated firewall, between the local area network  
and the router. While more expensive, this structure can help to protect internal devices  
from sophisticated attacks better protects the inside devices from possible attacks by the  
outside.

DMZ’s are an essential part of network security for both individual users and large organizations.  
They provides an extra layer of security to the computer network by restricting remote access to   
internal servers and information, which can be very damaging if breached.
