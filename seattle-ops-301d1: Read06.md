# Active Directory 
Microsoft release a proprietary directory service in in 1999 alongside Windows® 2000 Server edition. Active Directory  
provides a service that store data as objects known as a single element (user, group, application, device) are defined  
as resources or sercurity groups.

Active Directory categorizes objects by name and attributes. The main service in Active Directory is Domain Services (AD DS),  
which stores directory information and handles the interaction of the user with the domain. AD DS verifies access when a user  
signs into a device or attempts to connect to a server over a network. AD DS controls which users have access to each resource.  

## Active Directory services  
Several other services comprise Active Directory which are Lightweight Directory Services, Certificate Services, Federation Services  
and Rights Management Services. Each service expands the product's directory management capabilities. 

_Active Directory Domain Services features use a tiered layout consisting of domains, trees and forests to coordinate networked elements._  

## What AD Is & Isn’t
Although AD isn’t LDAP, it uses LDAP. AD is a directory service that is capable of communicating through the LDAP protocol and managing   
access to LDAP-based resources. _Active Directory is a software_   
AD is not a server either but requires a server in order to function. A server running Active Directory Domain Services software is known as a    
domain controller – whether that server is physical hardware located on-prem or virtualized.   
AD also isn't a database but instead contains a database that stores  users, groups, systems, printers, and policies within the network.
