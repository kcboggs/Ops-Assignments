# What is DNS?  

# A Brief History of the DNS  

_ Thirty years ago, when the Internet was still in its infancy when you wanted to visit a  
- website you had to know the IP address of that site. That’s because computers are and were  
- only able to communicate using numbers.

# How Does It Work  

- Nameservers store DNS records which are the actual file that says “this domain”  
- maps to “this IP address”. So is there a room somewhere that has all the nameservers  
- and DNS records for every site on the Internet?
