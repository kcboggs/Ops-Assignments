# What is Patch Management?
_Patch management is a process that involves the acquisition, review,  
and deployment of patches on an organization’s systems. This practice   
helps IT staff keep up with newly released patches and make sure the updates  
are correctly deployed, check their status after deployment, and log the procedure._

## What is a patch?

A piece of software code that improves an installed program – you can literally  
think about it as a “bandage” applied to software. 

_Generally, software patches can be categorized into three different categories  
– feature updates, bug fixes, and security updates._

* Feature Patches  
* Bug Fix Patches  
* Security PAtches

 be at high risk due to non-existent or delayed patching._
