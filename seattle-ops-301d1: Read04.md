# VPN 
Tunneling is the process of encrypting data and keeping it separate from other traffic on the internet.  
How does the tunneling process actually work?  
The best way to protect your data would be to never transmit it through the public network.  

##  What is VPN Tunneling?
Encapsulation insulates the packet of data from other data traveling over the same network, while  
encryption makes the data “invisible” (unreadable) even to surveillance agents and criminals who  
recognize it as encrypted information.

## What Is Split Tunneling All About?  
Split tunneling basically enables you to route some of your online activities through the VPN  
tunnel while you directly access the internet through your ISP for others.   

## What Do I Need to Know About Tunneling Protocols?  
* How fast is it?
* How secure is it?
* How easily can it transverse (get past) blocking software?
* How easily can I access and use it?  

## What Are the Different VPN Tunneling Protocols?  
A VPN tunneling protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules for data transmission and encryption.  
Some of the most commonly used protocols include Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), Layer  
Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol  
(SSTP), and Open VPN (SSL/TLS).
