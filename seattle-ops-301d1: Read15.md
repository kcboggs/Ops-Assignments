# Why diversity matters to your tech company  
_**Diverse companies perform better**_  
Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that  
a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.

_**Diverse teams are smarter and more creative**_  
According to Scott E. Page, professor of complex systems, political science and economics at the University of Michigan:
>"Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus,   
faster/better ways of solving it."

_**Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base**_   
Employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.
