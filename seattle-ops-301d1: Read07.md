# What Is Network Segmentation?

Network segmentation is an architectural approach that divides a network into multiple segments  
or subnets, each acting as its own small network. The purpose is to improve network performance  
and security. Segmentation works by controlling how traffic flows among the parts. 

## The Trust Assumption

High-profile breaches have called the trust assumption into question. For one thing, insiders can  
indeed be the source of breaches, often inadvertently but sometimes deliberately.  

## The Zero Trust Response

Because of the inherent weaknesses of assumed trust, many organizations have begun to adopt the Zero  
Trust strategy. Zero Trust assumes nobody is trustworthy by default, even those already inside the network perimeter.  

## Use Cases  

_Organizations can use network segmentation for a variety of applications_

Guest wireless network  
User group access  
Public cloud security  
PCI DSS compliance  

## Nuts and Bolts

Network segmentation can be implemented as either physical or logical segmentation.

## What enforces segmentation policy?  

Today, software-defined access technology simplifies segmentation by grouping and tagging  
network traffic. It then uses traffic tags to enforce segmentation policy directly on the  
network equipment, yet without the complexity of traditional approaches.

## What is microsegmentation?  

Microsegmentation uses much more information in segmentation policies like application-layer  
information. It enables policies that are more granular and flexible to meet the highly-specific  
needs of an organization or business application.   

## Benefits of network segmentation  

Improve operational performance  
Limit cyberattack damage  
Protect vulnerable devices  
Reduce the scope of compliance
